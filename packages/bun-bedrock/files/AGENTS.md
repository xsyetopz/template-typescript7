# Agent Instructions

- Install with `bun install`, and run one-off tools with `bunx`.
- Check each change with the narrowest command: `bun test <file>`, `bun check`, `bun run lint`, or `bun fmt`.
- Run `bun run verify` once before you finish a change that alters behavior.
- Fix the cause of each lint or type error in the code, and keep the lint and `tsconfig` settings as they are.
- Pin each dependency version once, in `workspaces.catalog`, and reference it as `catalog:`.
- Use Bun APIs where Bun has one, such as `Bun.file`, `Bun.$`, and `Bun.spawn`.
- Change shared lint, type, and Markdown rules in `bun-bedrock`, which the repo configs extend.
